## Converting from FormAPI to FormsUI (Virion)

This is from FormAPI

```yml
projects:
  YourProject:
    libs:
      - src: jojoe77777/FormAPI/libFormAPI
        version: ^2.1.0
```

And you would need to change it to this to FormsUI


```yml
projects:
  YourProject:
    libs:
      - src: Vecnavium/FormsUI/libFormsUI
        version: ^2.0.0
```

## Converting from FormAPI to FormsUI (As a plugin)

It's nothing more than a simple drag and drop FormsUI and replace FormAPI that is in your libs directory. And if you properly remove FormAPI and dropped FormsUI into the libs directory everything should work as expected. No code is needed to be modified or changed
